			<h2 class="header"> Industrial | 4:31 PM </h2>
			<p class="caption"> The "Industrial" photoshoot theme took place in a gritty parking alleyway, where I aimed to juxtapose the rugged industrial backdrop with high-class street style fashion. The contrast between the raw, urban setting and the sleek, sophisticated outfits created a striking visual narrative. The models donned stylish ensembles featuring designer streetwear, showcasing the fusion of luxury and urban culture. Against the backdrop of concrete walls, metal structures, and dimly lit surroundings, the photographs captured a sense of urban edge and refined elegance. The "Industrial" theme challenged traditional notions of beauty and showcased the allure of juxtaposing contrasting elements, resulting in a captivating and thought-provoking visual story. </p>

			<p> I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Michelle, the talented photographer who pitched the "Industrial" theme to me and invited me to model for her. It was an incredible experience collaborating with her on this creative project. Michelle's vision and passion for capturing the beauty in unconventional settings truly inspired me. Her professionalism and attention to detail throughout the photoshoot made me feel comfortable and confident in front of the camera.

			<p class="caption"> The "Hyperreality" photoshoot theme took place in a seemingly mundane parking lot, where the objective was to showcase how one can transcend into their own thoughts and imagination, even in such a banal setting. The photographs captured moments of introspection and contemplation, as the models were portrayed lost in their own world, seemingly disconnected from the surrounding environment. Through creative angles, lighting, and composition, the photos conveyed a sense of surrealism and otherworldly beauty, blurring the lines between reality and imagination. The theme aimed to highlight the power of the human mind to find inspiration and escape in the most unexpected places, reminding viewers that even in the most ordinary settings, extraordinary moments of self-reflection and personal growth can occur. </p>
			<p> I am incredibly fortunate to have Michi as my best friend since kindergarten. She is a remarkable individual who has always shown unwavering support and kindness. Currently, Michi is passionately pursuing her dream of becoming a nurse, dedicating herself to caring for others with empathy and compassion.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Michi for her willingness to participate in the shoot and for being such a reliable and supportive friend throughout the years. Her presence added an extra layer of joy and laughter to the experience, making it all the more memorable. I am truly grateful for her friendship and the many ways she enriches my life. </p>

			<h2 class="header"> FRESH WATER PEARLS | 5:32 AM </h2>
			<p class="caption"> This captivating photo, titled "Fresh Water Pearls," was captured on film, adding an element of vintage charm to its aesthetic. The image transports us to the enchanting island of Kauai, where my dad's hometown is nestled amidst the natural beauty of Hawaii. The photograph exudes a sense of tranquility and serenity as it showcases the glistening freshwater pearls scattered along the shoreline. The soft light and gentle waves create a serene ambiance, inviting us to immerse ourselves in the peacefulness of the moment. This photo serves as a poignant reminder of the beauty that can be found in the simplest of things, capturing the essence of my dad's hometown and the magical allure of Kauai. </p>

			<p> Visiting my dad's hometown was undeniably one of the most refreshing experiences, immersing me in the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of Hawaii. However, as a vegetarian, I faced some challenges when it came to finding suitable dining options. Traditional Hawaiian and Filipino cuisine, which predominantly features meat and seafood, posed limitations for my dietary preferences. Nonetheless, I managed to explore alternative culinary choices and appreciate the local fruits, vegetables, and plant-based dishes that showcased the diverse flavors of the region. Despite the occasional struggles with food, the rejuvenating experience of being in my dad's hometown, surrounded by stunning landscapes and embracing the island's laid-back lifestyle, more than made up for it. Finding solace in both city life and the tranquility of nature, this trip allowed me to strike a balance between urban exploration and the revitalizing energy of the natural world.</p>

			<h2 class="header"> "A HAZE, A DREAM ALMOST" | 2:37 AM </h2>
			<p class="caption"> The theme of "stargazing" evokes a sense of wonder, serenity, and exploration. It transports us to a tranquil night sky, where we gaze up at the vast expanse of stars. The concept of "haze" adds a layer of mystique and enchantment to this theme. It symbolizes the soft, ethereal quality that envelops the celestial scene, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The haze obscures the details and sharpness of the surroundings, emphasizing the sense of being lost in the cosmic expanse. It invites us to embrace the unknown, to let our imagination wander, and to find solace and inspiration in the limitless beauty of the universe. The theme of "stargazing" with a touch of "haze" awakens a sense of awe and curiosity, encouraging us to pause, reflect, and connect with the vastness of the cosmos.</p>
			<p> The quote "A haze, a dream almost" originated from my friend Xae, whose keen interest in astrophysics and philosophy seamlessly intertwine. Xae's fascination with astrophysics allows them to delve into the mysteries of the cosmos, exploring the intricate workings of the universe. Their studies in astrophysics have instilled in them a deep appreciation for the grandeur and awe-inspiring nature of the cosmos. Simultaneously, Xae's passion for philosophy enables them to contemplate the existential questions and ponder the meaning of our existence within the vastness of space. They find that these two fields converge beautifully, with astrophysics offering insights into the physical aspects of the universe and philosophy providing a framework for reflecting on the metaphysical and philosophical implications. The quote they shared, "A haze, a dream almost," encapsulates the ethereal and elusive nature of our cosmic exploration, inviting us to venture into the celestial haze with wonder and curiosity.</p>
